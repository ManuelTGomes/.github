## Hi there 👋

I'm Manuel, and I live in sunny Portugal 🇵🇹
I write a lot about Microsoft technology mainly and experiment a lot with other things as well. You can find my articles at https://manueltgomes.com/.

## ⏰ The schedule

I write six articles a week and keep a steady post schedule so that you can have fresh content to explore.

So you’ll start Monday with an article about [Microsoft Forms](https://manueltgomes.com/area/microsoft/forms/), [Microsoft Planner](https://manueltgomes.com/area/microsoft/planner/), and [Microsoft Teams](https://manueltgomes.com/area/microsoft/teams/), then follow on Tuesday with the “usual” [Power Automate](http://manueltgomes.com/area/microsoft/powerautomate/), [Power Apps](https://manueltgomes.com/area/microsoft/powerapps/) and [SharePoint](http://manueltgomes.com/area/microsoft/sharepoint/) posts.

We get the [Power Automate Action Reference](https://manueltgomes.com/area/reference/power-automate-action-reference/) on Wednesday.

Thursday, you’ll get **two articles** for the price of one, the [Power Automate Function Reference](https://manueltgomes.com/area/reference/powerautomate-function-reference/), [Power Apps Function Reference](https://manueltgomes.com/area/reference/powerapps-function-reference/), and [SharePoint List Function Reference](https://manueltgomes.com/area/reference/sharepoint-list-function-reference/) posts as well as an **additional** [Power Automate Function Reference](https://manueltgomes.com/area/reference/powerautomate-function-reference/) reference later that day. I felt that one post was not enough, so here you go 😀.

We'll finish the week on Friday with the [Power Automate Trigger Reference](https://manueltgomes.com/area/reference/power-automate-trigger-reference/).

Saturday and Sunday, we both rest and enjoy life 😀.

## 🍿 Fun facts about me

Some ask if my name shouldn't be Gomez. The short answer is: that's the [Hispanic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B3mez) way of spelling it, and I'm Portuguese. The long answer is on Wikipedia (where all "right" answers live). There you can find that:

> It derived from the given name Gomes, which derived from the Visigothic word guma, meaning "man"

… as well as that I'm not (yet) in the [Notable people list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gomes) 😀.
